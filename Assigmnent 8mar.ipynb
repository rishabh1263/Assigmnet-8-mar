    "What is the Probability Density Function?\n",
    "The Probability Density Function(PDF) defines the probability function representing the density of a continuous random variable lying between a specific range of values. In other words, the probability density function produces the likelihood of values of the continuous random variable. Sometimes it is also called a probability distribution function or just a probability function. However, this function is stated in many other sources as the function over a broad set of values. Often it is referred to as cumulative distribution function or sometimes as probability mass function(PMF). However, the actual truth is PDF (probability density function ) is defined for continuous random variables, whereas PMF (probability mass function) is defined for discrete random variables."
